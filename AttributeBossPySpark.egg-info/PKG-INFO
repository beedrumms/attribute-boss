# Introduction 
This project is supposed to help standardize attributes quickly leverging PySpark functions and at a very high-level so one can perform other preprocessing operations. The motivation is that most off-self libraries do to much. 

This library can:
   - standardize missing data (features - `missing_val_handler()`)
   - clean any str data (features - `clean_strs()`)
   - validate address, postal, and phone data (features - `validate_attribute()`)
   - standardize address data by removing aligning use of prefix and suffixes and street directions (standardize_attributes - `standardize_address()`)
   - standardize postal codes by removing common differences in representation (standardize_attributes - `standardize_postal_code()`)
   - standardize phone numbers by removing common differences in reporesentation (standardize_attributes - `standardize_phone_number()`)
   - standardize province and state names to abbreviated title (standardize_attributes - `standardize_province_state()`)
   - extract an address (street number, street name, street prefix / suffix, street directions) from a complex str (extract_attributes - `extract_address()`)
   - extract a postal code from a str (extract_attributes - `extract_postal_code()`)
   - extract a phone number from a str (extract_attributes - `extract_phone_number()`)

Signing off but inevitably back on -B 

# Getting Started
1.	Installation process
    - Install he lastest version of the libraries in requirements 

# Build and Test
- run python -m setup.py build? 
- run python -m setup.py install?

- run pytest test_xxxx.py in terminal

# Contribution Rules 
- contribute often and freely
- if fixing a bug -- push to the main branch with comment *fix-whatever-you-fixed*
- if adding a new feature - create a new branch with using the naming convention *feature-whatever-is-new*

# How to Use
- This library was built to quickly bring key attributes into alignment (Standardize) for further preprocessing tasks 
- it is build around the **assumption that Pandas DataFrames are being used**
- most of the functions leverage py dict structures to perform replacement tasks given that they are much more efficient than using for loops or step by step tasks
- with this in mind, the **input for each function should be a pd.Series** unless otherwise stated
- the output of **each function is a pd.Series**, which will make it easy to write it back to your DF
- ex:
   - `standardized_attribute = standardize_address(df['my_attribute'])`
   - `df['my_attribute] = standardized_attribute` 

# Suggested Steps for Implementation 
- this library was designed to be used in steps and **some functions rely on others to work properly**
- It is suggested that a user take the following approach:
   - for **address data**: missing_val_handler() --> standardize_address() --> extract_address() --> validate_attribute()
      - standardize_address() leverages cln_str() so it is not neccessary to use it 
      - extract_address() is looking for a matches based off the standard prefix / suffix / street direction abbreviations implemented via standardize_address 
      - validate_attribute() is looking only for NoneType data and returning a list of indices that match None -- in this way, extract_address() is actually validating your address data and returning None where it doesnt find a match. 
   - **any string**: missing_val_handler() --> cln_strs() 
      - cln_strs() performs basic cleaning in this order (the order is important): Changes str to uppercase, removes new lines, different types of apostrophies, periods, hyphens, parenthesis, adjusts commas. Replaces all types of french accents with standard letter. Removes all non-ascii characters, and finally remove any spaces more than one and trim any remaining whitespaces.
      - note that cln_strs() should be satisfactory for most categorical data -- however, it is not intended for text based data where puncuation matters! 
   - **postal, phone, or province data** missing_val_handler() --> standardize_xxx() --> extract_xxx() --> validate_attribute()
